## BetterMessageLinks
A plugin that allows you to view previews of Discord Message Links as a Tooltip and replace the long, useless link with any text of your choice.

This plugin uses code from [Strenchers MessageLinkEmbed](https://github.com/Strencher/BetterDiscordStuff/tree/master/MessageLinkEmbed) Plugin, which is based on [Jubys Plugin](https://github.com/Juby210/message-link-embed). Their code definetly helped me a ton in making this and I want to especially thank Strencher for the awesome support!
